Assimp for Unity is based on [AssimpNet](https://bitbucket.org/Starnick/assimpnet/). This project does not offer full support for AssimpNet and we will never offer it. This page is therefore incomplete and serves as a starting point for using AssimpNet. We encourage you to read official [AssimpNet](https://bitbucket.org/Starnick/assimpnet/) Documentation.
